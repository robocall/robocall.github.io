Hi! I'm Boris Bi. I'm a software engineer and a reformed engineering manager.
I like programming and understanding how things work.

I'm currently thinking about:
* how to use storytelling to explain technical subjects (I'm inspired by [Nicky Case!](https://ncase.me/crowds/))
* optimal public transit maps
* how technology can be used in animal welfare
* the history of money and work
* perverse incentives and how people actually make ethical decisions
* (broadly) improving my understanding of distributed systems

I have hot takes about:
* low/no-code systems
* the way tech companies structure their teams and projects
* what is the best dark chocolate

I think Flume (at Google, MapReduce outside Google) is one of the most beautiful things ever invented.

I enjoy lateral thinking puzzles and creating competitive programming problems. If you enjoy them too, here is one for the road:

> You have a microwave that has button 0-9 in the same shape as a [phone keypad](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-standard-12-key-telephone-keypad-character-layout-follows-the-ITU-E161-standard-8_fig1_221518150). The microwave accepts inputs in both minute:seconds and seconds. For example, 1:30 and 90 will both microwave your food for one minute and thirty seconds.

> You are very tired from working, so moving your finger from button to button has a cost M. Pressing a button has a cost B. Note that pressing ":" does not count as a button press.

> Given a list of n inputs, where each input is how long you need to microwave your food, M, and B, output what you would need to enter on the microwave to microwave your food for the minimum cost.
